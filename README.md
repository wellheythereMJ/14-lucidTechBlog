# lucidTechBlog 

The Tech Blog application is a CMS-style blog site built from scratch following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. 

Using Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize for the ORM, and express-session for authentication, developers can publish articles, blog posts, and engage in discussions with other users. 

This application is deployed on Heroku, accessible [here](https://lucid-tech-blog-afcc3e52c271.herokuapp.com/)
